# TopDownWaveShooter
#### * A game made for A levels which taught me how to use unity and implement the A* algorithm*
###### Keywords; Pathfinding, TopDown shooter, Unity Game Engine and OOP

In this project, I have made a top down abstracted shooter game that utalises a spawning mechanism that spawns enemies that increase in difficulty and numbers as time goes on*. The enemies utilise a constantly updating A* algorithm that routes the shortest path to the player using couroutines to achieve the result. 

## Key functionality of the project;
- A functional , albeit with limited Menu
- WASD Movement, Pressing R reloads the gun and mouse aim and left button to shoot.
- Waves of enemies with numerical displays on a basic UI
- Pathfinding enemies that deal damage to the player if come into contact.


## Areas for Improvement
Although the project works well for the functionality provided, since This project was developed at the beginning of my Career as a developer back in 2017, there are a lot of areas of improvement, here are some examples;
- There is a bug with collisions that gives the player some invulnerability for a couple of seconds
- * Since upgrading the game to one of the newer versions of Unity, the mechanism for spawning stronger enemies does not currently work due to one of the methods used to achieve that changing, however I do want to fix this when I have some free time(19/10/22) 
- There is no indicator for where a player is currently aiming at, nor if they reload, which would give a lot more information to the player.
- The menu is funcional but barren of functions, give the user the ability to customise their experience past the initial unity settings.
- Program in the leaderboard
- Add actual animations, and make the world less abstracted
- Add more types of enemies
- As stated above but with weapon types/ upgrades

these are some of the issues of my game and its Game Design, which , if given the time(Currently so god damn busy writing my dissertation and working full time), I would love to address as I enjoyed programming this game however stressful it was to learn in a year how to build a solid starter game without prior experience in Unity and Coding and game design itself and it put me on a road to become a developer.
